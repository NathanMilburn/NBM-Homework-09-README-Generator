## USER STORY
AS A Web developer
I WANT to create a module package that generates README files based on user submitted information
SO THAT I can easily create README files for future projects.

## DESCRIPTION
This is a module package that features both the inquirer and chalk package to accept user submitted information to generate a well formatted README file.

## PROCESS
Create the npm init package before downloading necessary dependencies. The next step was to create an inquirer prompt to accept user input that would fill out relevant project information. Lastly, I needed to create a function that creates the md file based on previously submitted information.
    
## USE CASES
Saving time on project development by structuring the README file with just user supplied information on their application.
    
## HOW TO USE APPLICATION
Open the console terminal, create a title for your project/readme, then follow along with the questionaire to input relevant data for the project's README file.
    
## FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
Make the formatting of the finalized readme file to look more appealing for future projects. Also to find ways that chalk can be implemented more to stylize the input prompts.
    
## CHALLENGES FACED
Having to test through the module over and over to make sure final structuring is as originally envisioned.

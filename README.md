## USER STORY
AS A Web developer

I WANT to create a module package that generates README files based on user submitted information

SO THAT I can easily create README files for future projects.

## DESCRIPTION
This is a module that features both the inquirer and chalk packages to accept user submitted information to generate a professionally formatted README file.

## APPLICATION IN USE

## INSTALLATION
Create an npm init package before downloading necessary dependencies. The next step was to create an inquirer prompt to accept user input that would fill out the relevant project information. Lastly, I needed to create a function that creates the md file based on previously submitted information.
    
## USAGE
Saving time on project development by structuring the README file with just user supplied information on their application.
Open the console terminal, type node index.js, then create a title for your project/README, then follow along with the questionaire to input relevant data for the project's README file.

## CHALLENGES FACED
Having to test through the module over and over to make sure final structuring is as originally envisioned.

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
Make the formatting of the finalized README file to look more appealing for future projects. As well as finding ways to incorporate the chalk module to further stylize the console logs/inputs.
